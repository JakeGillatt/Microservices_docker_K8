# What is Microservices?

Microservices refers to an architectural approach in software development where an application is broken down into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service focuses on performing a specific function or business capability within the application.

Microservices are essentially building blocks that work together to create a larger application. Instead of building one monolithic application, where all functionalities are tightly integrated, microservices divide the application into smaller, self-contained units. Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, which provides flexibility and agility in the development process.

These microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). They can be developed using different programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, as long as they adhere to the agreed-upon communication protocols.

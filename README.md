# What are Microservices?

Microservices, in simple terms, refers to an architectural approach in software development where an application is broken down into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service focuses on performing a specific function or business capability within the application.

Microservices are essentially building blocks that work together to create a larger application. Instead of building one monolithic application, where all functionalities are tightly integrated, microservices divide the application into smaller, self-contained units. Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, which provides flexibility and agility in the development process.

These microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). They can be developed using different programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, as long as they adhere to the agreed-upon communication protocols.
